# AbuseIPDB-to-Neo4j-EN
Project that uses the AbuseIPDB API to extract information from IPs that have performed some type of attack in the last 90 days, generating a CSV file with the IPs, the dates of the attacks, and the corresponding categories. This file can be subsequently loaded into Neo4j to generate a graph diagram.
